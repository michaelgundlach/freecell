# Freecell

## TODOs

- pubspec.yaml points to github playing_cards, not file
- random photos on AJQK
- App icon
- win animation
- feedback the more free cells you add
- race code to the side
- settings (easily extensible to add silly stuff over time?)
- pay https://www.pixtastock.com/illustration/48801783

- Make it look more like Tynker version, which is prettier:
  - Nice background color/image

- PR playing_cards changes

Finally:
- ship to store
