# Freecell

## TODOs

- feedback the more free cells you add
- race code to the side
- settings (easily extensible to add silly stuff over time?)
- win animation
- more button disappears, not fades out, when you click it

- Nice background color/image
- random photos on AJQK

Finally:
- PR playing_cards changes
- pubspec.yaml points to github playing_cards, not file
- ship to store
