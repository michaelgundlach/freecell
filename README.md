# Freecell

## TODOs

- race code to the side
- feedback the more free cells you add
- settings (easily extensible to add silly stuff over time?)
- win animation

- Nice background color/image
- random photos on AJQK
- music on intro, with floaty tiger.  what a cool sound!


Finally:
- PR playing_cards changes
- pubspec.yaml points to github playing_cards, not file
- ship to store
